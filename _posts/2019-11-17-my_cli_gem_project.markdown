Wheeew. This one was a struggle for me. The coding was fine, it went fairly smoothly. But the time needed to complete the project was a huge issue for me. 

It's been a while since I started it. 

A long while.

Not being able to work on it was starting to make my eye twitch.

But! I'm finally ready to submit my first project. And it feels awesome.

Here's a summary of how I progressed with it:

-Idea generation: I thought about things I like that can be presented as a list with details that can be hidden in a second layer. My first idea was a weird one, and probably a really bad idea for this project, but maybe something fun to do at some later point when I have time. My second thought was hey, I like books. There are websites that collect book information. Let's look into that. 

-Concept: Looking into the book idea, I came across the Goodreads Choice Awards. It seemed do-able to display some of that information, so I decided how I wanted to display it and what in particular I wanted to display. In clicking around the website, I paid attention to the link structure and inspected the page to see how they had things arranged. 

-Creating the structure: Here was my first problem. I got too excited and failed to read through the project instructions entirely. I found the instruction video for creating a gem, which was great. It felt pretty amazing to figure out the connection between my code in the Learn.co sandbox and GitHub. I had a few hiccups, but worked it out in the end. So I got my basic structure in.

-Making the program: This is when I started to really get excited. I made waaaay too many changes before I remembered to push things back up to GitHub. This is something I'm still struggling with. I think I'll make a nice big sign and put it right in front of me to remind myself to do that more in the future. And since I hadn't read all of the instructions, I was missing other parts of the project, like recording myself working on the code. Luckily I caught that one before I was completely done with it, but I suppose I could always add another feature to it if I needed to. 

-Project meeting: I had a meeting with Beth to go over what I had done so far. She helped me pinpoint what I still needed to work on, and helped me find a few issues with my code that I had overlooked because I solved that problem before I had changed something that broke it again. I realized I had become sloppy with my testing process and reevaluated that. 

-Finishing up: At this point, I had a massive break from coding in general. My job became extremely busy and I never had enough energy to more than look at the code for a few minutes. I also formed a bit of a mental block here. I almost didn't want to finish the project. But work settled down and I ran out of excuses. I came back, and I'm finishing this! I made changes from my notes with Beth, recorded my video, and now I'm finishing up the blog post. I'm excited to be moving forward again. 

I'm disappointed with myself for taking so long, but I won't let that happen again. Learn.co is a priority for me, and I'm going to treat it as such. Hitting the reset button now!
