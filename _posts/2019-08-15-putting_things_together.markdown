After finishing a sizable lab that ties together a bunch of stuff I've learned, I'm starting to understand things better. Seeing everything interact together was quite fun, and that makes it my favorite lab so far. 

I can see why it's important to write code that's clear. As the program got bigger and the methods more complex, I found myself bouncing back to different objects to make sure they had the functions I was about to try to use. 

I also learned how much hassle a missing bracket can cause. Thinking back on it, I'm pretty sure all of my roadblocks with that lab were due to small stupid mistakes or keyboard missteps. By the end of it I was finding them much faster, but there were more than I would have liked to see. I can see the importance of writing thorough tests too. I think there were 105 tests on the lab. Seems like a lot, but I know I would have gotten stuck a lot more than I did without them. They also served as a bit of a walkthrough on the lab, telling me exactly what to do next. To be honest, that kind of felt like cheat mode. I'd like to make something that doesn't come with a set of step-by-step instructions.

I did actually want to use "ask a question" for once. But I was working on the lab at about 5 am and it wasn't open. It didn't take me that long to solve my own issue though. And once I did I felt really dumb because it was just a missing bracket. If I had read the error through from the start I would have seen that right away. [*facepalm*] Lesson learned.

Clearing all 105 tests felt so good. I just want to bottle that feeling. On a related note, I've been fist pumping to myself so much when I pass tests that my dog thinks I'm going crazy.
