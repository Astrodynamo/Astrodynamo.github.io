`puts "Hello World!"` 

So here we are. Another beginner coder making another first post about coding. I could go into why I'm doing it, but that really only matters to me. 

Do you view coding as more of an [art or science?](https://www.quora.com/Is-programming-science-or-art)

To me, that's a trick question. It's a beautiful blend of both. Sure, you can apply the scientific method to coding. Make a hypothosis, try out some code, see if it works, etc. But there are some striking similarities between coding a program and painting a picture as well. Even if we are reading the same readme we can interpret it in different ways. Just as two people looking at the same rabbit can paint vastly different pictures of it, two people can code vastly different programs to accomplish the same task. 

Perhaps you see it differently. But then, isn't each person's path to learning how to code unique? My journey is mine alone. Just as your coding journey (if you are learning to code, of course) is entirely yours. Only I can make progress on my journey. Only you can make progress on yours. The scenery on this path is unique to your viewpoint, although we are passing the same trees along the way. 

Let's just enjoy the ride.

**My top beginner tips:**

* *Keep at it!* Don't give up too soon, your solution could be seconds away. Take a deep breath, keep calm, and code on.

* *Ask for help.* Getting stuck is nothing to be ashamed of. Recognize when you are truly stuck and let a kind, benevolent, more experienced programmer show you back to the path. 
* *Stay objective.* Don't judge the code or yourself. There is no reason to lay blame when something doesn't work, just fix it.

* *Always keep an eye out for a better solution.* As you work through your lessons, don't let yourself be satisfied just because something works. Look for a cleaner, faster way to do it. Learn to optimize your code. Code better, code faster, code stronger.

* *Learn from mistakes.* When you realize you did something wrong, you have an opportunity to learn from it. Instead of glossing over it, take some time to figure out why it happened, and commit the solution to memory. Don't make the same mistake over and over. That would be the real mistake.

* *Participate.* Yes, even if you're an introvert (like me). Post a message on slack, join a study group, talk to someone (anyone) about coding for a minute. You could gain some experience with the coding community, meet possible future coworkers, find a rival who is learning at your pace and fire each other up. Step out of your comfort zone and you just might learn something unexpected.
